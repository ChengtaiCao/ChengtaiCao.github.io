I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the City University of Hong Kong (CityU) under the supervision of [Prof. Jianping Wang (汪建平)](https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/persons/jianping-wang(0ff9fbf8-eeb5-4061-bcaf-029e3f282463).html). My academic journey began at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), where I earned my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Software Engineering in 2018 and 2021, respectively. During my master's studies, I was fortunate to work under the guidance of [Prof. Fan Zhou (周帆)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/info/1074/2722.htm), [Prof. Ting Zhong (钟婷)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/info/1074/2719.htm), and [Prof. Ji Geng (耿技)](https://sise.uestc.edu.cn/info/1035/9200.htm).

Between my master's and doctoral studies, I gained valuable industry experience as a strategy algorithm engineer in the [Department of Smart Office Platform (智能办公平台部)](https://infoflow-commercial.baidu.com/newweb/#/) at [Baidu (百度)](https://www.baidu.com/), one of China's leading tech companies. This year-long stint provided me with practical insights into the application of AI in real-world scenarios.

My research interests span a wide range of cutting-edge areas in artificial intelligence, including: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Autonomous Driving, Meta-Learning, Few-Shot Learning, Continual Learning, Graph Neural Network, Uncertainty, and Calibration. I have published 7 papers at the top international AI conferences and journals with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BbsnLQYAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.
