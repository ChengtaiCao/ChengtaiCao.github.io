- This work introduces SGDCL, a novel approach for explainable autonomous driving. SGDCL addresses critical shortcomings of existing methods via a semantic-guided learning module and a dynamic correlation learning module to learn category-specific features and model their interplay. Furthermore, we propose a novel loss item that leverages fine-grained co-occurrence statistics to regularize model training. Our comprehensive evaluation of two benchmarks demonstrates its effectiveness, surpassing seven state-of-the-art baselines and a large vision-language model. SGDCL improves prediction performance by a large margin and offers interpretable attention scores, enhancing the explainability and transparency of autonomous driving systems.

[CCTR: Calibrating Trajectory Prediction for Uncertainty-Aware Motion Planning in Autonomous Driving](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/30085) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='BbsnLQYAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC'></span></strong>

- This paper presents a novel CCTR framework to address the challenge of proper uncertainty calibration in trajectory prediction models, improving their reliability. CCTR offers a solution by introducing a calibration-oriented regularizer to align predicted variances with ground truth divergence and generating tailor-made temperature scalers for each prediction based on context and historical information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CCTR over various baselines in uncertainty estimation and downstream planning tasks, leading to better-calibrated predictions and more trustworthy planning. Moreover, the ablation studies show the effectiveness of each component, with in-depth empirical analysis verifying CCTR's desirable properties. Future work can exploit more advanced post-processing modules to further improve calibration quality.
