- This work introduces SGDCL, a novel approach for explainable autonomous driving. SGDCL addresses critical shortcomings of existing methods via a semantic-guided learning module and a dynamic correlation learning module to learn category-specific features and model their interplay. Furthermore, we propose a novel loss item that leverages fine-grained co-occurrence statistics to regularize model training. Our comprehensive evaluation of two benchmarks demonstrates its effectiveness, surpassing seven state-of-the-art baselines and a large vision-language model. SGDCL improves prediction performance by a large margin and offers interpretable attention scores, enhancing the explainability and transparency of autonomous driving systems.
